> The above Terminal emulator used is called [Hyper](https://hyper.is). The theme is called [hyper-dark](https://github.com/keesvv/hyper-dark), which is one of my forks.

# Compatibility

> This theme **ONLY** functions correctly if you have a [NerdFonts-patched font](https://nerdfonts.com/#downloads) installed on your system.

If you have a NerdFonts-patched font installed on your system, make sure you **also have the font selected as default in your terminal**.

To test if your terminal and font support it, check that all the necessary characters are supported by copying the following command to your terminal: `echo -e "\ue602 \ue725 \ue5ff \uf023 \uf132 \uf0e7 \uf00d \u23fe"`. The result should look like this:
