> The above Terminal emulator used is called [Hyper](https://hyper.is). The theme is called [hyper-dark](https://github.com/keesvv/hyper-dark), which is one of my forks.

# Compatibility

> This theme **ONLY** functions correctly if you have a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) installed on your system.

To test if your terminal and font support it, check that all the necessary characters are supported by copying the following command to your terminal: `echo "\ue0b0 \u00b1 \ue0a0 \u27a6 \u2718 \u26a1 \u2699"`. The result should look like this:
